# homework---machine-learning

  I got very high values for the first ipynb notebook. I thought maybe I did something wrong but AskBCS said my code was correct. In the first notebook all the model over, under, and combination sampling fit very well. 
  In the second notebook, the Balanced Random Forest Classifier had the more accurate model. In my analysis of that model, the top feature was 'total_rec_prncp', followed by 'total_rec_int', and 'total_pymnt'.
